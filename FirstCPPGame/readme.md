# ToadNamedDuck's Pong!

This is a pretty simple Pong recreation mostly made in C/C++ that features Single or Two-Player mode. This one is built mostly for the Windows API, and as such, needs to be built and run on a Windows machine.

# Controls and Gamemodes
The controls for the main player (left) are W and S for Up and Down. In single player mode, the other panel is not controllable, and is controlled by an AI Player. In VS, or Multiplayer Mode, the right-side panel is controllable with the Up and Down Arrow keys.

# Gameplay
The gameplay here is exactly what you'd expect - you try to score points against your opponent until you get bored, in which case you can use the pause menu to reset or to return to the main menu.

# Thoughts
I learned a lot through this process and I am glad to have finished it. I can't wait to take the knowledge I learned from this and apply what I learned (to do and not to do!) to my next project.
