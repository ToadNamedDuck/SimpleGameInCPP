//Code written by ToadNamedDuck, using a tutorial from Dan Zaidan as reference as I follow his tutorial on Youtube.

//This file is the Windows platform-specific code layer - this is PLATFORM DEPENDENT.

//Since we are devloping using the Windows API, we can find resources for future API requests on MSDN.
//Since we are making a graphical interface for the Windows platform, we need to include the windows.h header, and declare a WinMain as our entry point.
#include <windows.h>

//Create our window callback function.
LRESULT CALLBACK window_callback(HWND hwnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
	return DefWindowProc(hwnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam);
}

int WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nShowCmd) 
{
	//We need to create a window class
	WNDCLASS window_class = {};//Declare window
	window_class.style = CS_HREDRAW | CS_VREDRAW; //Allows us to draw to the window horizontally and vertically.
	window_class.lpszClassName = L"Game Window Class";//Give the window a name. L converts the type of the string.
	window_class.lpfnWndProc = window_callback;//This is the callback function that we use to receive communication from the window. every time something happens, like the windows receives input, this gets called.
	//Register the window class

	//Create the window!
