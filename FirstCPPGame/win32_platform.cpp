//Code written by ToadNamedDuck, using a tutorial from Dan Zaidan as reference as I follow his tutorial on Youtube.

//This file is the Windows platform-specific code layer - this is PLATFORM DEPENDENT.

//Since we are devloping using the Windows API, we can find resources for future API requests on MSDN.
//Since we are making a graphical interface for the Windows platform, we need to include the windows.h header, and declare a WinMain as our entry point.
#include <windows.h>

int __clrcall WinMain(
	HINSTANCE hInstance,
	HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,
	LPSTR lpCmdLine,
	int nShowCmd
) {
